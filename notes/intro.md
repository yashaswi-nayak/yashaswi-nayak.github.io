# Welcome

Hello There!

I am Yashaswi Nayak.

An Engineer, Animator and Dreamer.

Here on this corner of the internet you'll find my notes, articles on my experimentations with different tech.
I usually tinker around with new technologies and try to figure out why things are the way they are.

At my day job, I work as MLOps Engineer (tinkering with ML models, infrastructures and what not.)
At night I moonlight as an Animator.

Feel free to dive into my articles.
